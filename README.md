# Mississippi-University-Scholarship

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze alumni donation patterns to identify key donor segments and support data-driven fundraising strategies.


## Dataset

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Gift Amount** – Overall donations collected across all alumni.
2. **Average Gift Amount per Donor** – Mean contribution value to assess donor generosity.
3. **Donor Count** – Number of unique alumni who made contributions.
4. **Allocation-wise Contribution** – Donation totals segmented by allocation subcategory or gift purpose.
5. **Year-wise Donation Trend** – Gift amounts tracked across graduation years or donation years.
6. **Top Contributing Segments** – Highest donations by city, state, major, or college.


## Process Description

1. **Data Cleaning in Excel:** Removed duplicates, standardized text fields, formatted dates, and validated gift amounts to ensure data accuracy.
2. **Data Structuring:** Organized fields such as allocation category, demographics, academic details, and gift information for easy analysis.
3. **Dashboard Development in Tableau:** Imported cleaned data, created calculated fields, and built interactive charts to visualize donor trends and segment contributions.
4. **Insight Generation:** Analyzed patterns across demographics, majors, colleges, and allocation categories to identify high-value donors and fundraising opportunities.

## Project Insights

🎁 **Gift Allocation Analysis Insights**

  🗺️ **Geographical Representation and Gift Amount**
  1. **Top Contributing States:** California (CA) is the clear leader in terms of Gift Amount, followed by Texas (TX) and Colorado (CO).
     1. CA: $3,183,915
     2. TX: $2,744,992
     3. CO: $2,577,133
  2. **Geographical Scholarship:** The states with the highest scholarship representation (which likely correlates with the highest number of recipients or largest scholarship amounts) are NY ($1,004,047), TX ($1,037,272), and FL ($1,137,733).

  💰 **Gift Amount Allocation (Source/Purpose)** 
  1. **Dominant Allocation Areas:** The University Annual Fund and Faculty Chair Endowments account for a significant portion of the total gift amount.
        1. **University Annual Fund:** $2,492,738
        2. **Faculty Chair Endowments:** $2,011,067
  2. **College-Specific Allocation:** The College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the College of Communication Arts and Sciences received substantial amounts earmarked for them.
        1. **College of Agriculture and Natural Resources:** $1,241,066
        2. **College of Communication Arts and Sciences:** $310,262

  🧑‍🎓 **College Recipients and Gift Allocations**
  1. **Highest Number of College Recipients:** The College of Natural Science has the highest number of recipients (496), followed closely by the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Social Science.
  2. **Gift Fund Allocation:** The largest specific fund allocations are to the Diversity Fund ($2,656,507) and the Trustees Fund. The University Annual Fund and the general College of Natural Science fund also hold large allocations.

📈 **Gift Trends Insights**

  🎓 **College Recipients Trend**
  1. **Leading Colleges for Recipients:** The chart reinforces the previous finding, showing the highest number of recipients are in:
     1. College of Natural Science (496)
     2. College of Arts and Sciences (315)
     3. College of Social Science (311)

  📊 **Gift Amount vs. Graduation Year**
  1. **Spikes in Giving:** The amount of gifts appears to peak around the 1990 graduation year cohort ($1,228,090) and the 2000 cohort ($1,659,628). This suggests that graduates from these decades are currently the most active major donors.

  📅 Gift Amount vs. Year Distribution
  1. **Volatile Giving:** Gift amounts fluctuate significantly year-to-year. 2013 appears to be a major peak year in total gifts (with at least one fund reaching nearly $1,000,000), while 2014 shows a notable dip.

  🎯 Major vs. Gift Amount Distribution
  1. **Top Contributing Majors:** The Engineering/No Major category dominates the gift distribution ($562,519), followed by the Composition Mathematics and Aeronautics/Arabic majors. This indicates that alumni associated with these fields, particularly Engineering, provide the largest gift amounts.

  🗓️ **Heat Map of Gift Year Amount**
  1. **Consistent Giving Months:** The heat map suggests that certain months, particularly March, June, September, and December (or the last quarter), tend to see consistent activity/higher gift amounts across the years displayed (2010-2015).


## Conclusions

1. **Science and Engineering are Key Donor Bases:** The College of Natural Science consistently has the highest number of recipients (496), and the Engineering/No Major category contributes the largest single gift amount ($562,519). This indicates that the science and engineering fields are critical both for student support and financial contributions.
2. **West and Southwest States Dominate Giving:** California, Texas, and Colorado are the top three states, contributing over $8.5 million combined. This highlights a geographic concentration of major donors in the Western and Southwestern U.S.
3. **Recent Alumni (1990s-2000s) are Peak Donors:** Graduates from the 1990 and 2000 cohorts account for the largest gift spikes in the Graduation Year trend, with the 2000 cohort showing the highest total ($1,659,628). This suggests that cultivation efforts should prioritize these alumni groups.
4. **Annual Funds and Diversity are Primary Allocation Targets:** A large portion of the funds are directed toward the University Annual Fund ($2,492,738) and the Diversity Fund ($2,656,507), showing a strong institutional focus on general operations and diversity initiatives.


🚀 Future Scope

1. **Geographic Expansion:** Target development efforts to capitalize on high-potential states like CA, TX, and CO, while also analyzing growth opportunities in emerging markets.
2. **Cohort Optimization:** Prioritize engagement and major gift solicitation from the 1990 and 2000 graduation cohorts as they represent the highest current giving capacity.
3. **Programmatic Growth:** Leverage the existing strength of the College of Natural Science (high recipients) and the Engineering major (high gift amount) for potential campaign initiatives.
4. **Fund Development:** Analyze the sustained demand for the Diversity Fund and University Annual Fund to determine potential for endowment growth and annual fund goals.


💡 Recommendations
1. **Implement Targeted Digital Campaigns:** Launch specialized social and email campaigns for the 1990s-2000s alumni focusing on impact stories related to their college/major.
2. **Strengthen Major Gift Officer Deployment:** Reallocate resources to focus on the West and Southwest regions to service the concentration of high-value donors in CA, TX, and CO.
3. **Improve Stewardship for Core Funds:** Enhance personalized reporting and thank-you communications for donors contributing to the Diversity Fund and Faculty Chair Endowments to ensure retention and upgrades.
4. **Maximize Giving Seasonality:** Plan significant outreach and matching challenges during the high-activity months of March, June, September, and December.
